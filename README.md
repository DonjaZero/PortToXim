# Port To Xim

Teleport to @XimTheBard

## Features

* Use the `/ptx` command in chat, or...
* Optionally create a custom keybind so you can port to Xim at the touch of a button!

## What it does

Attempts to teleport your character to a guild member, friend, or guild member with the display name of "@XimTheBard".

## What it doesn't do

Anything else.

## Usage

Slash command
* "/ptx" or "/ptx group" to port to Xim as a group member (DEFAULT); Xim does not have to be "crown" or group leader
* "/ptx friend" to port to Xim as someone on your friends list
* "/ptx guild" to port to Xim as a guildie (member in a common guild)

Keybind

In Controls, set the addon keybind for "Port To Xim" based on your relationship to Xim (group member, friend, and/or guildie).

## Known issues

You must be able to teleport to @XimTheBard in order for this addon to work!  Xim must be online.  You must be in a guild with Xim, or you must be friends with Xim, or you must be in a group with Xim, depending on the command option or keybind chosen.  Xim must not have blocked you.  Xim must be in a location you can teleport to.  This excludes places like a house for which you do not have permission, a full instance, or a zone you do not have access to (content you have not purchased).

## Notes

Created upon a request from @Kattatonia, who ports to Xim an absurd number of times. To be fair, both Xim and Kattatonia are quite excellent ESO players and exemplary community members. The question really is "Why aren't YOU porting to Xim, too?"

## Releases

Releases in the form of a ZIP file that one may extract to their ESO "AddOns" folder are provided in the "releases" subdirectory.  Be sure to extract all, including the folder name!

Port To Xim is now also available on ESOUI and via Minion, the MMOUI addon manager.
