# Port To Xim

Teleport to @XimTheBard

## Features

* Use the `/ptx` command in chat, or...
* Optionally create a custom keybind so you can port to Xim at the touch of a button!

## What it does

Attempts to teleport your character to a guild member, friend, or guild member with the display name of "@XimTheBard".

## What it doesn't do

Anything else.

## Usage

Slash command
* "/ptx" or "/ptx guild" to port to Xim as a guildie (member in a common guild); this is the default
* "/ptx friend" to port to Xim as a friend
* "/ptx group" to port to Xim as a group member (Xim does not have to be "crown" or group leader)

Keybind

In Controls, set the addon keybind for "Port To Xim" based on your relationship to Xim (guildie, friend, and/or group member).

## Known issues

You must be able to teleport to @XimTheBard in order for this addon to work!  Xim must be online.  You must be in a guild with Xim, or you must be friends with Xim, or you must be in a group with Xim, depending on the option or keybind chosen.  Xim must not have blocked you.  Xim must be in a location you can teleport to.  This excludes places like a house for which you do not have permission, a full instance, or a zone you do not have access to (content you have not purchased).
